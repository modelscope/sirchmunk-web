# Sirchmunk

**Raw Data to Self-Evolving Intelligence**

Sirchmunk is an open-source, embedding-free, agentic search engine that transforms raw data into self-evolving intelligence in real time.

## Key Features

- **Embedding-Free Retrieval** — No vector database, no pre-indexing, no ETL pipeline. Drop your files and search immediately.
- **Self-Evolving Knowledge** — Knowledge clusters compound with every search, delivering faster and richer results over time.
- **Monte Carlo Evidence Sampling** — Extract precise evidence from large documents without reading them in full.
- **ReAct Agent Fallback** — An autonomous agent iteratively explores alternative strategies when standard retrieval falls short.
- **Multi-Surface Integration** — MCP, REST API, WebSocket, CLI, and Web UI — all built in.
- **Token-Efficient Design** — LLM inference only when necessary. Monte Carlo sampling and knowledge reuse minimize costs.
